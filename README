A simple, minimal RogueLike demo (an @ moving around a hardcoded map) implemented in multiple languages.

Trying to follow the idioms of those languages and keep things very, very simple - which is why the initial version doesn't make use of objects in most of the languages. 

Would love to see more languages in here or improvements made by people who know any of these languages better than I do.
